# Product Requirements Document

## HubSpot UI Extension Integration with Replit Reports

### Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for building a HubSpot UI Extension that integrates with existing Replit-hosted reports. The solution will enable displaying custom reports within HubSpot's CRM interface through iframe modals, utilizing a public app approach with OAuth authentication via a Vercel bridge.

### Project Overview

#### Business Context

- **Current State**: Reports are hosted on Replit with REST API endpoints
- **Goal**: Surface these reports within HubSpot CRM interface
- **Approach**: Public App UI Extension with OAuth bridge on Vercel

#### Key Stakeholders

- **Development Team**: Agency developers
- **End Users**: Sales teams using HubSpot CRM
- **Client Organizations**: Companies using the integrated reports

### Functional Requirements

#### 1. HubSpot Integration

- **UI Extension Card**: Display in CRM record pages (contacts/companies)
- **Report Selection**: Dropdown to choose available reports
- **Iframe Modal**: Display selected reports in modal window
- **Context Passing**: Pass HubSpot contact/company IDs to reports

#### 2. Authentication & Authorization

- **OAuth Flow**: Public app OAuth 2.0 implementation
- **Token Management**: Secure storage and refresh of access tokens
- **User Permissions**: Respect HubSpot user access levels
- **Multi-tenant Support**: Handle multiple HubSpot accounts

#### 3. Report Management

- **Dynamic Availability**: Check which reports have data for specific records
- **URL Generation**: Create secure, contextualized report URLs
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing data

#### 4. User Experience

- **Loading States**: Show progress indicators
- **Error Messages**: Clear user feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Work across different screen sizes
- **Performance**: Fast load times (< 3 seconds)

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Security

- **OAuth Security**: Implement PKCE flow for enhanced security
- **Token Storage**: Encrypted storage in Vercel
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin settings
- **Data Privacy**: No sensitive data stored in Vercel

#### Performance

- **API Response Time**: < 500ms for availability checks
- **UI Responsiveness**: < 100ms for user interactions
- **Caching**: Implement appropriate caching strategies

#### Scalability

- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Support unlimited HubSpot accounts
- **Concurrent Users**: Handle 100+ simultaneous users
- **API Rate Limits**: Respect HubSpot's rate limiting

#### Compliance

- **HubSpot Requirements**: Follow UI Extension guidelines
- **Data Protection**: GDPR/CCPA compliance
- **Security Standards**: OAuth 2.0 best practices

### User Stories

#### As a Sales Representative

1. I want to view customer reports directly in HubSpot
2. I want to see only reports with available data
3. I want reports to load quickly and reliably
