# HubSpot CLI Research Complete

## Task Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Research Scope
Comprehensive research on HubSpot CLI, public app development, UI extensions, and integration requirements for the Sales Intelligence project.

## Key Findings

### HubSpot CLI Requirements
- **CLI Version**: Must use `@hubspot/cli@latest` for UI extensions support
- **Account Requirements**: HubSpot Enterprise access required for CLI usage (Sales or Service Hub Enterprise)
- **Authentication**: Personal access key required for CLI authentication
- **Project Creation**: Template-based project creation with `getting-started-public-app` and `display-iframe-modal`

### Public App vs Private App
- **Public Apps**: 
  - Available to all HubSpot accounts via App Marketplace
  - Can be installed by multiple accounts
  - Requires full OAuth flow with PKCE
  - Limited to 20 concurrent requests per installed account
  - Best for broader market reach

- **Private Apps**:
  - Enterprise-only, single account installation
  - Simpler token-based authentication
  - Cannot be distributed via marketplace
  - No concurrent request limitations
  - Best for internal Enterprise tools

### UI Extensions Implementation
- **Template**: `display-iframe-modal` provides iframe integration pattern
- **Security**: Must use `hubspot.fetch()` for all API calls (no direct external calls)
- **Object Support**: Can target CONTACT and COMPANY objects
- **Location**: CRM record pages with custom card integration
- **Limitations**: 20 concurrent requests per account limit applies

### OAuth Security Requirements
- **PKCE Flow**: Proof Key for Code Exchange required for enhanced security
- **Client Secrets**: Must remain server-side only (never in frontend)
- **Token Storage**: Encrypt tokens before storing in Vercel KV
- **Redirect URLs**: Must match exactly between HubSpot app and deployment
- **Token Refresh**: Implement refresh 5 minutes before expiry

### Vercel Deployment Process
- **Environment Variables**: Use `vercel env pull` for local sync
- **Production Deployment**: `vercel --prod` for production deployment
- **Domain Configuration**: Custom domains require SSL certificate setup
- **CORS**: Configure for HubSpot domains (app.hubspot.com)
- **Monitoring**: Built-in function logs and error tracking

## Documentation Created

### 1. hubspot-cli-research.md
Complete guide covering:
- CLI installation and setup
- Project creation with templates
- UI extensions implementation
- OAuth configuration
- Security best practices
- Testing and debugging

### 2. vercel-deployment-guide.md
Comprehensive deployment guide covering:
- Environment variable management
- Production deployment process
- Database configuration
- Security headers and CORS
- Monitoring and troubleshooting

### 3. Updated CLAUDE.md
Added new sections:
- HubSpot CLI Development Workflow
- Public App vs Private App Guidelines
- Vercel Deployment Workflow
- UI Extensions Implementation Guidelines
- OAuth Flow Implementation Requirements
- Environment Variable Management

## Critical Requirements Identified

### For User Action
1. **Enterprise Access**: User must have HubSpot Enterprise access for CLI usage
2. **Developer Account**: Must create account at https://developers.hubspot.com/
3. **Public App Creation**: Follow setup guide with proper OAuth configuration
4. **OAuth Credentials**: Provide Client ID and Client Secret for integration

### For Implementation
1. **PKCE OAuth Flow**: Enhanced security required for public apps
2. **hubspot.fetch()**: Only allowed method for API calls from UI extension
3. **Token Encryption**: Mandatory before storing in Vercel KV
4. **Redirect URL Matching**: Must match exactly between app and deployment

## Next Steps

### Immediate (User Action Required)
1. Create HubSpot developer account with Enterprise access
2. Follow updated setup guide in `/Tasks/9-HubSpot-Public-App-Setup.txt`
3. Create public app with OAuth configuration
4. Provide Client ID and Client Secret

### Development (Ready to Execute)
1. Deploy backend to Vercel using documented process
2. Configure environment variables for production
3. Update HubSpot app redirect URLs to Vercel domain
4. Implement OAuth flow in backend
5. Upload UI extension via CLI

## Blockers Resolved
- ✅ CLI workflow and requirements documented
- ✅ Public vs private app decision clarified (public app chosen)
- ✅ UI extension implementation pattern identified
- ✅ Security requirements fully specified
- ✅ Deployment process documented

## Remaining Blockers
- ⏳ User needs Enterprise access for HubSpot CLI
- ⏳ OAuth credentials needed from user's public app setup

## Impact on Project Timeline
- **Positive**: Clear roadmap and requirements identified
- **Consideration**: Enterprise access requirement may affect user's timeline
- **Mitigation**: Complete setup guide provided for efficient execution

## Resources Created
- Complete CLI workflow documentation
- Step-by-step deployment guide
- Updated project guidelines in CLAUDE.md
- Task tracking with dependencies and blockers

## Completion Date
June 24, 2025 - 12:00 UTC
