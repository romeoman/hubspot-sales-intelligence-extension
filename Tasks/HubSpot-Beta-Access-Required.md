# HubSpot React Extensions Beta Access Required

## Current Issue
The test accounts don't have access to the React extensions beta, which is required for creating UI extensions with React components.

## Error Message
```
Couldn't create a React extension with your file `/app/extensions/sales-intel-card.json` because your portal (`146425449`) doesn't have access to this beta.
```

## What You Need to Do

### Option 1: Sign Up for Beta Access (Recommended)
1. Visit: https://app.hubspot.com/l/whats-new/all?update=13937343
2. Sign up for the public apps beta
3. Wait for beta access to be granted to your account
4. Once granted, the upload will work

### Option 2: Use Legacy CRM Cards (Alternative)
If beta access is not available, we can use the legacy CRM cards approach which uses:
- Custom CRM cards with serverless functions
- iframe display without React components
- Less modern but widely supported

### Option 3: Use Main Developer Account
Your main developer account might already have beta access. Try:
```bash
hs account use man-digital-dev
hs project upload
```

## What We've Built So Far

### Project Structure ✅
```
hubspot-public-app/
├── src/app/
│   ├── public-app.json         # App configuration
│   ├── extensions/
│   │   ├── sales-intel-card.json  # CRM card config
│   │   └── SalesIntelCard.jsx     # React component
```

### Features Implemented ✅

- Report selection dropdown
- iframe modal integration
- Error handling and loading states
- API integration with backend

### Code Ready ✅
- React component with HubSpot UI extensions
- Proper context usage
- openIframeModal integration
- Fetch API for backend communication

## Next Steps Once Beta Access is Granted

1. **Upload Project**
   ```bash
   cd packages/hubspot-public-app
   hs project upload
   ```

2. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   hs project dev
   ```

3. **Deploy to Production**
   ```bash
   hs project deploy
   ```

## Alternative: Legacy CRM Card Approach

If beta access is not available, we can create a legacy CRM card that:
1. Uses serverless functions instead of React
2. Renders HTML with JavaScript
3. Still opens iframe modals
4. Works without beta access

Would you like me to implement the legacy approach as a backup?
