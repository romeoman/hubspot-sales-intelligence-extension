## Current Status: Ready for Development Testing

The CLI is asking you to set up the test account for local development. Here's what you need to do:

### Next Steps for You:

1. **Answer the CLI prompts**:
   - When asked "Continue with CRM_UX_CARD [test account]?" → Answer **Y**
   - You'll be prompted to get another Personal Access Key for the test account
   - Follow the browser flow to authenticate the test account

2. **After test account setup**, the dev server will start and you can:
   - Test the extension locally in the HubSpot test environment
   - Make any necessary adjustments to the UI
   - Verify the components work correctly

## Next Major Steps (After Local Testing):

### 1. Deploy Backend to Vercel
```bash
cd packages/vercel-backend
vercel --prod
# Update OAUTH_BRIDGE_URL in constants.js with actual URL
```

### 2. Deploy Sales Intel Backend
```bash
cd packages/sales-intel-backend  
vercel --prod
# Update SALES_INTEL_API_URL in vercel-backend env vars
```

### 3. Create the Public App in HubSpot
- Go to https://developers.hubspot.com/
- Create a new public app
- Use the configuration from our `public-app.json`
- Get Client ID and Client Secret

### 4. Upload Extension to Production
```bash
cd packages/hubspot-project
hs project upload
hs project deploy
```

## Important URLs to Update Later

Once you have the actual Vercel URLs, update these files:
- `packages/hubspot-project/src/app/utils/constants.js` (line 2)
- `packages/hubspot-project/src/app/public-app.json` (lines 5, 7)

## What's Working Now
- ✅ HubSpot CLI authenticated and project created
- ✅ All UI extension code integrated and configured
- ✅ Project dependencies installed
- ✅ CRM card configured for contacts and companies
- ✅ Ready for local development testing

## What's Pending
- 🔄 Test account authentication (current step)
- ⏳ Local development testing
- ⏳ Backend deployment to Vercel
- ⏳ Public app creation in HubSpot portal
- ⏳ Production deployment and testing

The project is in excellent shape! Once you complete the test account authentication, you'll be able to test the extension locally in HubSpot.
