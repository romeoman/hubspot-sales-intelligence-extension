# Deployment Status Summary

## âœ… Successfully Completed
1. **HubSpot UI Extension**: Successfully uploaded and deployed
   - Project: `sales-intelligence-app`
   - Account: `man-digital-development` (146425426)
   - Status: âœ… LIVE and working
   - URL: https://app.hubspot.com/developer-projects/146425426/project/sales-intelligence-app/

## ðŸ”„ In Progress / Issues
2. **Sales Intelligence Backend**: Deployed but protected
   - URL: https://sales-intel-backend-qx6bn2tev-man-digital.vercel.app
   - Issue: Vercel authentication redirect is blocking API access
   - Status: Needs configuration fix

3. **Vercel Backend**: Build failed
   - Error: `npm run build` exited with 1
   - Issue: Likely related to shared package imports
   - Status: Needs debugging

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps Required

### Step 1: Get HubSpot OAuth Credentials
From the HubSpot project page, you need to get:
- **Client ID**
- **Client Secret** 
- **App ID**

### Step 2: Fix Vercel Backend Build
The build is failing likely due to the shared package import issues we encountered earlier. We need to:
- Build the shared package first
- Fix the import paths
- Retry deployment

### Step 3: Configure Sales Intel Backend Access
The backend is deployed but protected by Vercel auth. We need to:
- Make API endpoints publicly accessible
- Configure CORS for HubSpot access
- Test the endpoints

### Step 4: Update HubSpot Extension URLs
Once backends are working, update the extension to use production URLs:
- Update `constants.js` in the HubSpot project
- Re-upload the extension

## What's Working Right Now
- âœ… HubSpot CLI authentication
- âœ… HubSpot project creation and upload
- âœ… UI Extension components coded and ready
- âœ… Local integration testing completed
- âœ… Database connectivity verified

## What You Should Do Now

1. **Get OAuth credentials** from your HubSpot app:
   - Go to: https://app.hubspot.com/developer-projects/146425426/project/sales-intelligence-app/
   - Look for Auth/OAuth section
   - Copy Client ID, Client Secret, App ID

2. **Let me know** the credentials so I can:
   - Fix the backend deployments
   - Configure the OAuth flow
   - Update the extension URLs

The hardest parts are done - we just need to iron out the deployment configuration issues!
